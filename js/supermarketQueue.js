There is a queue for the self-checkout tills at the supermarket. Your task is write a function to calculate the total time required for all the customers to check out!

There is only ONE queue serving many tills, and
The order of the queue NEVER changes, and
The front person in the queue (i.e. the first element in the array/list) proceeds to a till as soon as it becomes free.
