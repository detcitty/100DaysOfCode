'''
Consider a deck of 52 cards, which are represented by a string containing their suit and face value.

Your task is to write two functions encode and decode that translate an array of cards to/from an array of integer codes.

function encode :

input : array of strings (symbols)

output : array of integers (codes) sorted in ascending order

function decode :

input : array of integers (codes)

output : array of strings (symbols) sorted by code values

['Ac', 'Ks', '5h', 'Td', '3c'] -> [0, 2 ,22, 30, 51] //encoding
[0, 51, 30, 22, 2] -> ['Ac', '3c', 'Td', '5h', 'Ks'] //decoding
'''


def encode(cards):
    return

def decode(cards):
    return
