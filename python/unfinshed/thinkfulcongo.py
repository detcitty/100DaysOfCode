'''
Write a function box_capacity() that figures out how 
many crates you can store in a given warehouse. The 
function should take three arguments: the length, width, 
and height of your warehouse (in feet) and should return an 
integer representing the number of boxes you can store in that space.
'''

def box_capacity(length, width, height):
    '''
    For example: a warehouse 32 feet long, 64 feet wide, 
    and 16 feet high can hold 13,824 boxes because you 
    can fit 24 boxes across, 48 boxes deep, and 12 boxes high, 
    so box_capacity(32, 64, 16) should return 13824.
